Slide 1 — Title
- Twist ERP: The Self‑Evolving Business OS
- A visual, AI‑powered, drag‑and‑drop ERP for modern SMEs
- Own your data. Runs on your PC/server. Works over LAN.

Notes:
- Set the tone: simple, modern, practical. Emphasize ownership and on‑prem flexibility.

---

Slide 2 — The Problem We Solve
- Big ERPs are slow, costly, and hard to change
- Imports from Excel are painful and error‑prone
- Teams chase deadlines across email and spreadsheets
- You need IT staff just to make small changes

Notes:
- Keep it relatable with examples: late GRNs, AP late fees, budget deadlines.

---

Slide 3 — Our Vision (Plain English)
- Your business, your way — the system adapts to you
- Build screens, approvals, and reports visually (no code)
- AI helper that guides, warns, and can do the work for you
- Start fast with industry templates; grow at your own pace

Notes:
- Stress no‑code and time‑to‑value. Mention industry packs (manufacturing, NGO, trading).

---

Slide 4 — What Makes Us Different
- Smart imports: upload Excel/CSV → we auto‑map your columns
- If your data has extra fields, we propose adding them — your data shapes the ERP
- Everything is visual: screens, approvals, and reports without developers
- Action‑capable AI (not just chat): “Submit this budget” → done, with audit and permissions

Notes:
- Tell one story: import a messy sheet, map in seconds, add missing fields, start working.

---

Slide 5 — Your AI Companion
- Proactively reminds you: budgets due, items running low, bills coming up
- Answers in context: “Top 5 customers by margin this quarter?”
- Can act for you (with your permission): approve requests, post receipts, submit budgets
- Always safe: follows roles, approvals, and policies; everything is logged

Notes:
- Show a screenshot of the AI drawer with Agenda + action buttons.

---

Slide 6 — What You Get (Modules)
- Core Operations: Inventory & Warehouse; Manufacturing/Production; Procurement; HR & Payroll; Logistics
- Finance & Control: GL, AP/AR; Budgeting; Fixed Assets; Quality & Compliance; Policies & Docs
- Strategy & Growth: Sales & CRM; Projects & Tasks; AI & Analytics; No‑Code Customization
- All modules talk to each other in real‑time

Notes:
- Use a simple 3‑column table visual. Emphasize integration.

---

Slide 7 — Inventory That Works for You
- Costing: FIFO, LIFO, Weighted Avg, Standard cost with audit
- Landed costs: allocate freight/customs, even with late invoices
- QC & Compliance: quarantine/hold/released; FEFO; batch/serial/expiry
- GRN workflows: approvals enforced; overdue deliveries flagged in agenda

Notes:
- Share an example: late GRN triggers alert; one‑click to post when approved.

---

Slide 8 — Finance You Can Trust
- AR/AP/GL with journal vouchers and clear audit trail
- Real‑time postings: stock movements reflect instantly in the ledger
- 3‑Way match: policy explanations when something can’t be posted
- Cash flow analysis tied to live AR/AP

Notes:
- Show simple cash flow tile with AR/AP and a short AI explanation.

---

Slide 9 — Budgeting Without the Pain
- Entry → review → approvals with grace periods
- Cost center approvals; variance tracking and comments
- Real‑time consumption from GRNs; remaining quantity/value visible
- Threshold alerts: near breaches and overruns auto‑surfaced

Notes:
- Demo path: open budget → submit → CC approval → GRN posts → usage updated.

---

Slide 10 — No‑Code You’ll Actually Use
- Form Builder: add or change fields via drag‑and‑drop
- Workflow Builder: “If PO > $5k → CFO approval” (no code)
- Report Builder:
  - Pick data, drag columns, add filters, group and sum
  - Create charts and KPI tiles; schedule emails and exports
  - Role‑based sharing; always audited

Notes:
- Mention the code base’s report builder plan and toggles. Keep it practical.

---

Slide 11 — Auto‑KPIs & Scorecards (Simple and Fair)
- What we track: approvals on time, overdue items cleared, suggestions acted on, data fixes
- Scoring: each gets a 0–100 per role (Finance, Inventory, Budget Owner), then combined
- Users see: dashboard and weekly summary — “Approvals on time: 92% (+8%)”
- Privacy: managers see team totals; individuals see their own; configurable weights

Notes:
- Tie to telemetry service and workflow events. No creepiness, only useful feedback.

---

Slide 12 — Your Daily Agenda
- Budgets nearing deadlines (adds across open periods)
- POs waiting for GRN; bills due soon
- Workflows that are stuck too long
- Every item has context and one‑click actions with confirmation

Notes:
- This is the habit‑forming surface. Show how it reduces “firefighting.”

---

Slide 13 — Migration That Doesn’t Hurt
- Upload spreadsheets; we match columns automatically
- The system suggests adding missing fields; you confirm
- Clean up errors with clear, human guidance from the AI helper
- You bring your history with you, quickly

Notes:
- Stress that migration is a first‑class, AI‑assisted capability.

---

Slide 14 — No Big IT Team Required
- Runs on a single PC or simple server; works offline/LAN
- Admin page for backups and updates
- Visual configuration — change flows/forms/reports yourself
- Roles, approvals, audit, and security built‑in

Notes:
- Position this as “business‑led change,” IT‑light, partner‑friendly.

---

Slide 15 — Simple Architecture (High‑Level)
- Backend: Django + DRF; Celery for scheduling
- AI: skill router → action executor → audit + telemetry
- Data: RBAC‑aware query layer; workflows; logging
- Knowledge: local vector search (FAISS) + policy docs
- Frontend: React; AI drawer with agenda and actions

Notes:
- Show one diagram box per layer; avoid jargon.

---

Slide 16 — Who We Serve
- Manufacturing / Garments / Textiles
- Trading & Distribution / FMCG
- NGOs & Donor‑Funded Projects
- Service businesses (IT/Telco)

Notes:
- Explain on‑prem advantage (cost, control, compliance) and AI time‑savings.

---

Slide 17 — Status & Roadmap
- Today: platform foundation; Inventory & Finance base; Budgeting end‑to‑end; AI agenda + actions
- Next: workflow studio, report builder, OCR for AP/GRN, more detectors
- Pilots: Inventory + Budgeting go‑live in 2–4 weeks

Notes:
- Make it clear we can start small and expand.

---

Slide 18 — Business & GTM
- Model: self‑hosted license per company; per‑user tiers; add‑on modules
- Services: support SLAs; partner implementations; optional hosting
- GTM: start with manufacturing/NGO; channel partners; land‑and‑expand

Notes:
- Highlight predictable costs, fast time to value, and partner leverage.

---

Slide 19 — Why Invest
- Big, underserved SME market needing modern, flexible tools
- Real differentiation: AI that safely takes action, not just chat
- On‑prem option wins on cost, control, and compliance
- Strong base already built — lowers risk and time to revenue

Notes:

- Use: polish (workflow/report/ocr/detectors), partner onboarding, pilots, QA
- 12‑month goals: 50+ paying companies; 10+ partners; >80% core module attach

Notes:
- Replace the raise amount as needed; align goals with funds.
